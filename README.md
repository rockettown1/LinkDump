# Basic UI for collecting useful links.

Log in, and post links. Ability to view all links, and submit a new link (if you're logged in). Also added the functionality of upvoting liks.

Technical:

Front end is Reactjs, with a graphQL API using the react-Apollo client. Queries from the front end are sent to prisma (a graphQL interface for databases.) Back end is made in Nodejs.
